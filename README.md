# The Web We Want

## What is it?

If you build websites, you inevitably run into problems. Maybe there’s no way to achieve an aspect of your design using CSS. Or maybe there’s a device feature you really wish you could tap into using JavaScript. Or perhaps the in-browser DevTools don’t give you a key insight you need to do your job. We want to hear about it!

## Adding Events

You can add events by editing [the `events.json` file](./_data/events.json).

## Adding Wants

You can add new "Wants" by creating a new markdown file in [the `wants` directory](./wants/). Feel free to duplicate an existing problem and use that as a template.

## Local development

### 1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi.git webwewant.fyi
```


### 2. Navigate to the directory

```
cd webwewant.fyi
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Run Eleventy (builds the site)

```
npx eleventy
```

Or build automatically when a template changes:
```
npx eleventy --watch
```

Or in debug mode:
```
DEBUG=* npx eleventy
```
